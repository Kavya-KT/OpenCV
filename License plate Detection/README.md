This code creates an interactive Streamlit app that allows users to upload an image, detects a license plate in the image, performs OCR to extract the text, and then looks up and displays the vehicle's details based on the extracted license plate number.
It uses a combination of image processing with OpenCV, OCR with EasyOCR, and data manipulation with Pandas.
